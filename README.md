# AVR Calculator Project

## Description
This AVR calculator project is designed for the AVR microcontroller and 
includes features such as basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), 
handling operands with more than one digit, support for negative numbers, 
memory of the last value for use in new operations, 
and special handling for division, including integer and fractional parts display and 
detection of math errors (division by zero).

___

## Features
### Basic Operations:
The calculator supports fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Multi-Digit Operands:
Operands can be more than one digit, allowing users to input and calculate with larger numbers.

### Memory of Last Value:
The calculator retains the last calculated value, allowing users to use it in subsequent operations without re-entering.

### Division Handling:
Division results are displayed with an integer part and two numbers for the fractional part. 
Additionally, the calculator detects and handles math errors when attempting to divide by zero.
